## Common Mistakes

### Persisting Timer-Dependent State

When a persisted Zustand store records metadata for an in-memory timer, persist
only serializable metadata and convert any active/pending timer state to an
interrupted state before writing storage.

Example: card auto restart keeps retry `setTimeout` handles in
`TerminalEventBridge`, not in `terminalStore`. Persisted card state may retain
retry history for user context, but a pending retry must be written as cancelled
because the timeout will not survive reload.
