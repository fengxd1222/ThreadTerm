## Component Structure

<!-- Standard structure of a component file -->

### Local UI Primitives

When a plan calls for a shadcn/ui primitive, verify that the primitive exists under
`src/components/ui/` before importing it. If the package/dependency is not present,
add a small local primitive in `src/components/ui/<primitive>.tsx` that matches the
component API needed by the feature instead of adding a new runtime dependency by
default.

Example: `BottomActionBar` uses `src/components/ui/popover.tsx` for a lightweight
`Popover` / `PopoverTrigger` / `PopoverContent` API because `@radix-ui/react-popover`
is not installed in this project.
